# "Rubbing Elbows Pt. 2"
## Act 2, Session 5

**Key Characters:** [Proxima Windfall](/NPCs/Proxima%20Windfall.md), Eria, Quantar, Argosy

Following their initial introductions at Proxima Windfall's estate, the party continues to circulate through the gala, engaging with key figures and uncovering significant information about Proxima's connections and potential motivations.

## Details
- **Deepening Connections**:
  - Further investigation of Eria reveals she has been Proxima's account manager at Cinderknife for decades
  - The relationship predates Proxima leaving the People's Engine council
  - Eria maintains a professional but clearly longstanding personal connection to Proxima
  - Still unclear why Proxima would need such personalized and frequent interaction with a PMC now that he is retired

- **Quantar's True Purpose**:
  - The heavily-modded man reveals his affiliation with the [Echo Reliquary](/Factions/Warband/Echo%20Reliquary.md)
  - Present at the gala as an official representative of the warband
  - His primary mission is intelligence gathering about potential AI/NHP relics
  - Specifically interested in undiscovered technological wreckage in the [Virelian Wastes](/Locations/Virelian%20Wastes.md)

- **Union Political Divisions**:
  - The party overhears heated discussions between Union dignitaries as they continue drinking
  - Two clear factions have emerged regarding the [Virelian Civil War](/Events/Virelian%20Civil%20War.md)
  - Hardline faction: Advocates for full Union absorption of [Virelia](/Locations/Virelia.md) and imposition of direct Union governance
  - Diplomatic faction: Prefers a mediated resolution between the existing planetary governments
  - The division suggests Union internal policy on Virelia remains unsettled

- **Clandestine Investigation**:
  - The party manages to explore portions of Proxima's estate without arising suspicion
  - Discovery: The entire estate operates on an isolated, offline-only tech system
  - Completely disconnected from the PE mesh network
  - Suggests either deep distrust of PE network security or deliberate avoidance of the PE governance AI's oversight

- **Security Revelations**:
  - Discreet conversation with one of Proxima's security personnel
  - Proxima exclusively contracts with a specific private security firm
  - The firm is notable for not employing AI warmechs
  - Despite the higher cost and smaller scale compared to PE security options
  - Deliberate choice suggests Proxima's possible aversion to AI systems or oversight

- **Implications**:
  - Proxima's systematic avoidance of AI oversight and monitoring becomes increasingly apparent
  - His long and continued relationship with Cinderknife raises questions about his operations outside of PE oversight
  - The presence of faction representatives and information gatherers indicates the strategic importance of the gala beyond mere socializing
