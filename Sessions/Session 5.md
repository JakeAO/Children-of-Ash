# "Echoes Pt. 2"
## Act 1, Session 5

**Key Characters:** [ECHO](/NPCs/ECHO.md), [Tezha Olai](/NPCs/Tezha%20Olai.md)

The party finishes off the last of the defense turrets and makes their way into the facility on foot. They discover signs of forced entry and evidence that something valuable was dragged through the facility. Inside, they encounter an AI targeting computer named ECHO who reveals itself as their mission contractor. After retrieving ECHO, the party faces a standoff with Tezha Olai of Cinderknife but manages to escape with clever deception.
