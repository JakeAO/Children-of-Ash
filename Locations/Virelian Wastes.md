# Virelian Wastes

**Type:** Desert Scrubland

### Description
The Virelian Wastes is the desolate expanse of land situated between the territories controlled by the [People's Engine](./People's%20Engine.md) and the [Noble Rook Confederacy](./Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md). This region bears the scars of countless battles, with craters, wreckage, and abandoned war machines scattered across its surface. The Wastes is a haven for scavengers and rogue warbands, who sift through the remnants of war for valuable resources.

### Notable Features
- **Battlefield Ruins:** Sites of major conflicts, now littered with destroyed mechs and war debris.
- **Scavenger Camps:** Temporary settlements of scavengers eking out a living.
- **Danger Zones:** Areas still riddled with unexploded ordnance and automated defense systems.
