# Virelian Civil War

**Type:** War  
**Also known as:** War for Virelia

A protracted, planet-spanning conflict between the [Noble Rook Confederacy](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md) and the [People's Engine](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md) that lasted roughly two centuries and left [Virelia](/Locations/Virelia.md) scarred, depopulated in places, and riddled with hazardous war tech. The war ended only when the [Union](/Factions/The%20Union.md) re-established contact and imposed an armistice following the catastrophic [Ashfall Incident](/Events/Ashfall%20Incident.md).

## Details
- **Duration & Scope**:
  - Approximately 200 years of near-constant fighting across cities, deserts, and polar frontiers, with shifting borders and repeated cycles of escalation and ceasefire.
- **Combatants & Doctrines**:
  - [NRC](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md): Traditional military hierarchy; rank-and-file regiments commanded by noble houses; emphasis on honor, formations, and ritualized command.
  - [PE](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md): High-tech doctrine; AI/NHP-directed warmechs, autonomous drone swarms, and integrated satellite networks for ISR and strikes.
- **Conduct & Atrocities**:
  - Both sides committed war crimes, including the use of chemical agents and indiscriminate bombardment. Civilian casualties mounted over generations; no belligerent emerged clean.
- **PMCs & Third Parties**:
  - Dozens of PMCs rose and fell, variously partisan, neutral, or opportunistic—motivated by profit, ideology, or humanitarian aims.
  - Notables include: [Ironveil](/Factions/PMC/Ironveil.md) (war-era powerhouse), [Cinderknife](/Factions/PMC/Cinderknife.md) (black-ops and wetwork), [Ashfall](/Factions/PMC/Ashfall.md) (post-war neutral force), and [Union Containment Corp](/Factions/PMC/Union%20Containment%20Corp.md) (stability-focused).
- **Catalyst for Union Oversight**:
  - The [Ashfall Incident](/Events/Ashfall%20Incident.md)—triggered by a cascading NHP that issued rapid orbital strike orders—drew Union scrutiny and became the tipping point for intervention.
- **Ceasefire & Imposed Peace**:
  - Upon reconnecting with Virelia, the [Union](/Factions/The%20Union.md) threatened direct intervention unless hostilities ceased; an armistice was imposed alongside demilitarization measures (e.g., disarming orbital networks) and external oversight.
- **Aftermath & Legacy**:
  - The [Virelian Wastes](/Locations/Virelian%20Wastes.md) remain littered with wrecks, UXO, rogue systems, and salvage economies.
  - Emergence of neutral or semi-neutral actors like [Ashfall](/Factions/PMC/Ashfall.md) to enforce ceasefires, clean up war tech, and stabilize hot spots.
  - Persistent distrust between NRC and PE, with proxy conflicts and deniable operations continuing under the veneer of peace.
