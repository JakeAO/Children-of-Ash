# The Ashfall Incident

**Type:** Battle  

During a protracted battle between [PE](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md) AI warmechs and [NRC](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy/md) warmechs in a populated area, an NHP commander on the PE side cascaded and issued so many orbital bombardment orders in short succession that the entire battlefield, city, and everyone involved were obliterated in an instant.  
This disaster is the primary cause for the [Union](/Factions/The%20Union.md) returning to exert their "imposed peace" over [Virelia](/Locations/Virelia.md).
