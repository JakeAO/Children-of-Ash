# The Ashfall Incident

**Type:** Battle  

A catastrophic engagement during the late stages of the [Virelian Civil War](/Events/Virelian%20Civil%20War.md). In an [NRC](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md)-controlled frontline city—only partially evacuated and far west of the NRC’s cemented holdings—days of mutual bombardment and brutal urban mech fighting culminated in a cascading [PE](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md) NHP commander issuing rapid, overlapping orbital strike orders. The resulting saturation barrage erased the battlefield, the city, and combatants from both sides, along with allied PMCs and civilians. The disaster forced the [Union](/Factions/The%20Union.md) to re‑establish contact with [Virelia](/Locations/Virelia.md) and impose peace through force.

## Details
- **Location & Civilians**:
  - Densely populated NRC city on the western frontier beyond consolidated NRC lines.
  - Evacuation was incomplete; PMC‑contracted civilian auxiliaries were assisting under fire.
- **Prelude (Days of Escalation)**:
  - Prolonged battery and orbital strikes from both sides degraded comms and ISR.
  - Repeated chemical alarms and area denial left neighborhoods and corridors uninhabitable.
- **Engagement (Close Quarters Urban Combat)**:
  - [PE](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md) and [NRC](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md) Lancers clashed at block‑to‑block ranges among high‑rises and industrial yards.
  - Multiple PMCs operated in parallel: partisan units executing strikes and sabotage; neutral elements on escort, medevac, and containment tasks.
  - Named participants included wartime heavies like [Ironveil](/Factions/PMC/Ironveil.md) and black‑ops outfits such as [Cinderknife](/Factions/PMC/Cinderknife.md).
- **Catalyst (NHP Cascade)**:
  - A PE NHP battlefield commander, under contradictory directives and signal latency, cascaded.
  - Safety interlocks and strike deconfliction failed under stacked authorizations; the NHP issued a flurry of orbital fire missions in seconds.
- **Immediate Effects**:
  - Multi‑vector orbital strikes saturated the urban battlespace, collapsing infrastructure and annihilating forces and bystanders.
  - Surviving comms described “whiteout” and then silence; recovery was impossible.
- **Union Response**:
  - The scale and speed of destruction triggered Union intervention: oversight re‑established, armistice imposed, and orbital bombardment networks disarmed or dismantled (systems like [ECHO](/NPCs/ECHO.md) were reportedly decommissioned in the process).
- **Legacy**:
  - Became the symbol of the war’s excesses and the tipping point for the ceasefire.
  - In the aftermath, [Vann Solis](/NPCs/Vann%20Solis.md) and other veterans helped found [Ashfall](/Factions/PMC/Ashfall.md), a neutral PMC focused on stabilization, cleanup, and containment.
