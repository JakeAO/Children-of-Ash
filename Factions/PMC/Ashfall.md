# Ashfall PMC

**Abbreviation:** AF

## Summary
Union-sanctioned neutral mercenary outfit founded in the aftermath of the [Ashfall Incident](/Events/Ashfall%20Incident.md) roughly a decade ago by [Vann Solis](/NPCs/Vann%20Solis.md), formerly of [Ironveil](/Factions/PMC/Ironveil.md). Ashfall accepts contracts from the [People's Engine](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md), the [Noble Rook Confederacy](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md), the [Union Containment Corp](/Factions/PMC/Union%20Containment%20Corp.md), and independent clients. They strive to remain neutral while upholding baseline humanitarian standards and de-escalation in the war-torn wreckage of [Virelia](/Locations/Virelia.md).

## Details
- **Founding & Background**:
  - Established in response to the devastation of the [Ashfall Incident](/Events/Ashfall%20Incident.md).
  - Founded and led by [Vann Solis](/NPCs/Vann%20Solis.md), an ex-[Ironveil](/Factions/PMC/Ironveil.md) Lancer, who rallied former contacts, locals, and disillusioned pilots under a neutral banner.
- **Mandate & Clients**:
  - Takes contracts from [PE](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md), [NRC](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md), [UCC](/Factions/PMC/Union%20Containment%20Corp.md), and independents.
  - Follows conflict-of-interest rules (no simultaneous partisan operations in the same theater; cooldowns between opposing-side jobs).
- **Organization & Structure**:
  - Command: [Vann Solis](/NPCs/Vann%20Solis.md) (Commander).
  - Communications: [Nini Shoju](/NPCs/Nini%20Shoju.md) (Chief Communications Officer).
  - Lancer Corps: Mixed-origin pilots vetted for discipline and ROE compliance.
  - Recovery & Containment: Salvage, demining, and quarantine of hazardous war tech.
  - Security & Peacekeeping: Convoy escort, site security, ceasefire enforcement, and stabilization.
  - Recon & Intel: Survey, risk assessment, and contract scoping.
- **Rules of Engagement (ROE)**:
  - Neutrality protocols; minimize collateral damage; no atrocities.
  - Civilian protection and evacuation prioritized when feasible.
  - Contain rogue AI/NHPs and hazardous systems per Union guidelines.
- **Relationships**:
  - [UCC](/Factions/PMC/Union%20Containment%20Corp.md): Cooperative but cautious—often uses Ashfall as a deniable fixer.
  - [PE](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md) & [NRC](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md): Pragmatic engagement as buffer/cleanup between warring interests.
  - [Cinderknife](/Factions/PMC/Cinderknife.md): Hostile rivalry; CK resents Ashfall’s “goody-two-shoes” ethos carried on by Vann and the legacy of [Dmitri Solis](/NPCs/Dmitri%20Solis.md).
