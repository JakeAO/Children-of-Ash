**Abbreviation:** CK

## Summary

## Details

  - Served as a black-ops and wetwork organization for both the [People's Engine](/Factions/The%20People's%20Engine.md) and the [Noble Rook Confederacy](/Factions/Noble%20Rook%20Confederacy.md).
  - Undertook missions that even the AI warmechs of PE and the Lancer pilots of NRC refused to execute.
- **Conflict with Ashfall PMC**:
  - Deep hatred for [Ashfall](/Factions/PMC/Ashfall.md), stemming from Dmitri Solis of [Ironveil](/Factions/PMC/Ironveil.md), who was a constant thorn in their side and upheld a "goody-two-shoes" reputation.
  - Vann Solis continues his brother Dmitri's legacy in Ashfall, further fueling Cinderknife's animosity.
- **Reputation**:
  - Known for hyper-violence and a lack of moral restraint.
  - Their pilots, like [Tezha Olai](/NPCs/Tezha%20Olai.md), embody the faction's ruthless and psychopathic tendencies.
