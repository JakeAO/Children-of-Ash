# The People's Engine

**Abbreviation:** PE  

Techno-socialist collective. Groupthink culture. Old AIs integrated into infrastructureâ€”some resentful. Veterans are augmented, broken, or zealously loyal. PE society is governed by highly advanced AI and NHP entities in a mesh network that issue edicts for a council to implement and enforce. Life in the PE metropolis is good so long as you follow the rules and maintain the social order, and short if you don't.
