# Brazen Thorn Warband

An unaligned warband descended for early settlers of Virelia and deserters from the war. Known for hijacking and repurposing both warmechs and industrial mechs for their cause. A constant thorn in the side of both the PE and NRC, but never enough to stage an all-out assault against.
